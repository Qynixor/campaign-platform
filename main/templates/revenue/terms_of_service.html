        <ul>
            <li>Clearly stating the goal, purpose, and nature (financial, awareness, community-building, etc.) of your Cause.</li>
            <li>Using any funds raised solely for the stated purpose of the Cause.</li>
            <li>Posting honest and regular updates about your progress, challenges, and outcomes.</li>
            <li>Complying with all applicable laws regarding fundraising, taxes (if applicable), and consumer protection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Financial Transactions & Fees</h2>
