            <li><strong>Support Information:</strong> If you support a cause, we collect necessary transaction details (like donation amount). For financial transactions, payment information is processed by secure third-party providers (e.g., PayPal) and we do not store full credit card details.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the platform, such as your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and the causes you follow or support.</li>

            <li>To facilitate the creation of causes, the posting of progress updates, and the processing of support (financial or otherwise).</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience, such as showing you causes you might be interested in.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about your account, the causes you start or support, important platform updates, and security notices.</li>
            <li>To understand how the platform is used so we can develop new features and improve existing ones.</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We respect your privacy. We do not sell your personal information. We may share it only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> Your public profile information and the content of the causes and updates you post are visible to other users as intended by the platform's functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted third-party companies to perform services like payment processing, data analysis, and customer support. They are contractually obligated to protect your data.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or to protect the rights and safety of Rallynex, our users, or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition, your information may be transferred as a business asset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

            <li><strong>Communication Preferences:</strong> You can opt-out of non-essential promotional emails by using the unsubscribe link in those emails.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. Disabling cookies may limit your use of certain platform features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
